the legal ownership of guns by ordinary citizens inevitably leads to many accidental deathsthe legal ownership of guns by law-abiding citizens inevitably leads to many unnecessary and tragic deaths. legally held guns are stolen and end up in the hands of criminals, who would have greater difficulty in obtaining such weapons if firearms were less prevalent in society. guns also end up in the hands of children, leading to tragic accidents and terrible disasters such as the columbine high school massacre in the u.s.a. sometimes even normal-seeming registered gun owners appear to go mad and kill, as tragically happened at hungerford and dunblaine in the u.k.

the death penalty should be abolishedhi, i wanted to discuss a very important issue: the death penalty as a progressive i'm against it and my view is getting more and more support as i see that those in favor of the death penalty have little or no valid argument. here are some fact: _the death penalty costs more than life imprisonment _there is absolutely no evidence that it deters crime (just look at crime rates in the us compared to europe wich abolished it) _for every 100 executed prisoners there are likely 4 innocent people being executed _it diminishes society to the same moral level as the criminals _human behavior is mostly determined by the environment and can be changed by a caring environment (in approx. 80% of violent criminals) -the countries who abolished it usually have lower crime rates then those who didn't _the death penalty creates a society that promotes revenge and bloodthirst after all these arguments i know no death penalty supporter who was able to give me a valid reason why i should support it. so i'm asking the the death penalty supporters in the debate.org community if they are able to do so (i don't think so but i'm an open-minded individual)

ban plastic bags in grocery storeswell sometimes children can get to things that are far away or put up. true paper kills trees, but they don't rip as bad when you have milk or something very heavy. some stores do not take bags that break that is the problem it depends where you live and what policies the store has. yeah reusable bags are great, but at what cost? everything kills something now days so they can make something else. this is all i have to actually say now. this debate was fun and i liked it. thank you. good luck

gun bani am only aware of the debate topic because of the title. if what you are proposing is a full on gun ban, then how do you propose it is done. in what way is it possible to magically get rid of all guns? if the government were to ask everyone to hand there guns in then only law abiding citizens would comply, then only criminals would own guns, then who has the power? despite the fact that it was senseless, i will respond to your side of the argument. you are proposing that if no one has a gun, then no one has power over one another. at least that's what i believe you think, as you hadn't gone as far as to state what you meant. in that case then people would resort to other weapons, or make there own guns. in any way, the can of worms has been opened, and making a law that disarms no one except the law abiding citizen will do nothing to help matters. the safest way to keep us safe is to let us arm ourselves if we want and for the government to do its best to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people. in short guns will never go away because if we ban them then the black market will prevail.

existence of godfirst round is opening, second rebuttals and third closing. as i am suggesting god exists the burden of proof is on me. when looking at the universe we can see that all the entities that we know of are contingent in the sense that their existence cannot be explained without reference to another entity. for example my existence cannot be explained without reference to my parents. therefore if all parts of the universe are contingent then it follow that the universe is contingent. so it follows there must be a cause of the universe. this cause is either itself caused by something or is has necessary existence (meaning exists and could not failed to have existed). if it has necessary existence then we have found god and if not then it has a cause. however if we follow the causes back they cannot go back ad infinitum lest the series could never have begun. so god must exist as the initial cause of the universe.

abortion should be banned in americatrue, the freedoms granted to us in the constitution are many. however, nowhere in the constitution is any provision made for any abortion. while there are indeed certain clauses that seemingly would allow them in principle, i see no place where it is stated, mainly because it was never an issue in the time of the founding of the us. furthermore, my opponent has generalized those who will receive an abortion as those “who are either not ready or too poor to support a child.” while this summarizes some of those who will receive an abortion, this certainly cannot be true of all or even a majority of those who will receive an abortion. then, my opponent uses an appeal to pity and asks the question “would you like to be unwanted? dirt poor? malnourished?” as if the choice to ban abortion will lead to a bunch of poor malnourished children lying in the streets with cardboard signs saying “feed me” my opponent then states that if we ban abortion, the immediate result is children dying and suffering in this world. while this may be true for some cases, this is by no means a general rule. it also is a slippery slope, that if we do this one thing, this exact thing will happen to everyone, therefore, the first thing should not happen. while i did feel pity for those who my opponent described, i have found little logical basis for deciding that outlawing abortion would be wrong. thanks! : )

death penaltythe death penalty has a purpose. people who have killed many and even thousands cant be sentence to death? death penalty should exist because when someone commits a crime that's so violent the end result can cause hundreds to die. if there is no death penalty then the maniac will still kill more people. death penalty is used to get rid of bad people so bad that hundreds die. if you think the death penalty is bad because it kills people you must not know what the purpose of it is. the death penalty is a way to put fear into the criminal and to put fear into others. crime has decreased and the death penalty still lives. several tests have shown that the death penalty is an effective deterrent of future crimes. do people who commit heinous crimes, such as the bombers, really have human rights. to say that we are lowering ourselves to that level is wrong. killing over 200 innocent lives. we have to look as well at the possibilities of these criminals committing crimes again. in australia murder, on average, is imprisonment for 12 years. this means many murders are set free, able to commit further crimes. benefits of death penalty - decreases jail over population - puts fear into other criminals and shows a purpose - it avenges innocent lives - it decreases crime. without the death penalty -over population of crime in jail - more criminals roam around - citizen would be feared. probably could cause strikes on government, - crime rate goes up it is on to you now

the feeling of security generated by possession of tactical nuclear weapons will give states the political will to decommission standing nuclear arsenals.development and deployment of tactical nuclear weapons can be viewed as a suitable replacement for the thousands of strategic nuclear missiles and launchers being decommissioned as part of the recently ratified new start between russia and the united states, which represents a major step toward non-proliferation of strategic nuclear weapons. the treaty exempts tactical nuclear weapons by omitting them from the language of the treaty, including as yet undeveloped miniature warheads, as both the united states and russia have come to see the possession and deployment of tactical nuclear weapons as key to their national security. replacing large numbers of strategic nuclear weapons with a smaller quantity of lower capacity tactical weapons marks a major movement away from proliferation of potentially world-destroying weaponry. furthermore, the movement from proliferation of unusable strategic weapons to tactically viable, smaller nuclear weapons can be used as a means of allaying the fears of citizens in the united states, russia, and other countries pursuing policies of non-proliferation that their countries nuclear defenses are not only still viable, but more practicable.

death penalty in u.s.ausa is the only western country in the world who has death penalty. 38 states in usa have death penalty. you cannot get a death penalty for every crime you make. the only crime where you can get a death penalty is if you commit a premeditated murder. i think that death penalty should be illegal in all the states in america, one of the reasons is, i think it is moral wrong, to kill another human no mater what the person has done. the 10 commandments say that, ""you shall not murder"" i know that a person who get the death penalty have committed a murder but when the government kills a person with death penalty is that not a murder or what? i do not think it should be legal even though if you are the government. i think that it is human to make a mistake and a lot of the persons who get the death penalty have not committed more then one murder, so why shall they be killed for the crime they have committed, maybe when they have been drunk or something like that, i do not say that a person who has committed a crime do not have to be punished. i think that if you have committed a premeditated murder then you shall be sent to prison for lifetime instead of being killed (life time shall not be for the rest of your life only for a long time) and then they can sit in a prison and think about what they have done wrong. what do you think? i would like to hear your version of the death penalty:

the death penalty should be legal in all us states.for some, the death penalty could be less worse than jail. the death penalty is only used when absolutely needed, and sometimes it is the only rational/moral option. even if a criminal was released from the death penalty/jail, it would be very hard for them to make a living. the death penalty can be painless. the death penalty provides disclosure for victims. if the death penalty is not in use, then america will end up spending more money trying to contain criminals from the outside world. many lives could be saved by each execution of a guilty killer.

reducing speed reduces deathsthis argument is based on government adverts, and is no way backed by statistical evidence. it is in fact the very fast and the very slow drivers that cause accidents. those who drive in the 80th to 90 percentile are the safest drivers[[brian gregory, the times online, april 2009]]. this shows that instead of attacking that safe percentile, the slow and the extremely fast should be penalised. harsher enforcement of very fast drivers, and slow drivers should also be apprehended. therefore, instead of reducing the speed limit to below that safe percentile, why not ensure those who are very fast and very slow keep to the current speed limits. spending limited resources in this area will see a greater degree of road safety. ---------------------- << this is saying that people obey the speed limit, which they do not.

mandatory childhood vaccinesthere are laws about what vaccines are required for a visa both to certain countries and from them. unless the african family hid in a suitcase while going to a country without the disease, taking a vaccine would be mandatory and the proof of vaccination (usually a yellow sheet of medically verified paper) would be required to get the visa. if they already had the disease they would have failed the blood tests required to get the visa and/or vaccination in the first place. you seem to not understand that although some vaccinations should be mandatory to make all vaccinations mandatory for children would be most ridiculous and be wasting precious biological resources which could save adults and/or be used to better understand the virus as opposed to worrying about wasting it on vaccinating children in a nation where that microorganism isn't even present.

the bible is reliablebasically, my contention is that the bible was transmitted accurately which makes it reliable. even if some of the stories in the bible sounds too good to be true it does not mean it was not transmitted accurately. the bible is actually a collection of books that was written by people who did not know each other in some cases but yet in whole forms one unified book that compliment and confirm each other. prophecy is an example of this. people argue either that there are contradictions in the bible or point out the "genocide" found in the bible. war and genocide does not prove the bible is unreliable. however, contradictions can question the reliability of the bible. some try to point out that the bible contains scientific faults which would fall in the category of contradictions with so called learned knowledge. evolution would be such an example. however, evolution without it's origins (how it started, cosmology) ends up being adaptation. people try to split evolution from it's origins to try and built a case that cannot be argued against, but as i pointed out, it because adaptation. the origin theory is a theory. it cannot be proven by scientific methods and cannot be verified using the scientific method, so in short, how can the bible contradict something that cannot be proven? the bible warns against science "falsely so called". others point out events that seem to contradict who god should be and what he should and should not allow. i find that most of the time people who argue this way does not have a good knowledge of bible theology. having said all that, let me hear your arguments!

guns should be banned1) uses for guns the government cannot insure the complete safety of its people all the time, and for that reason, the right to own a gun comes in handy. a gun can help thwart a burglary, allows a person to respond to a lethal threat with equal force, possibly allow someone to stop a mass shooting from escalating if they are living in a concealed-carry region, and in very depopulated states like wyoming and alaska where people routinely have to hunt to get food, guns come in handy. guns should not be banned since there are some good uses for them that justifies their existence 2) impossibility of collecting all the guns if they are banned lets say you ban guns. great, now how do you go about actually collecting all of them? just because you ban guns, that doesn't mean everyone will be willing to actually turn in their guns, even if given an incentive. there will be people who will hang on to their guns if they are banned, and since it would be literally impossible for the government to legally confiscate all guns, banning them is a bad idea since its pretty much unenforceable.

In the same way, if you could be wrong about everything you think you know, it follows that you know nothing - in which case you can't know what I can know, which you started to talk about... If you say "no", then I would like you to tell me one thing you can know for certain.

all religions need to unite, and understand what religion actually isi believe that all religions should unite, and truly understand what religion is, as if believers are capable to hold wars due to their different religions, they are completely looking at the wrong end of what religion is. first of all i would like to clarify what i consider as a religion: a religion is a group of people that worship to do good, appreciate what they have, seek to help others, and acknowledge that there must be a creator of the universe.

nations should be allowed to possess nuclear weapons in self defensenuclear weapons are an excessive form of self-defense. there is no reason that nuclear weapons are necessary in order for a country to defend itself; these weapons can only be seen as hostile and antithetical to the idea of global cooperation and peace. if no nations had nuclear weapons, there would be no need to have second strike capabilities. further, nations have committed atrocities in the name of self defense, and there clearly need to be some well-define limits constraining what a nation can and cannot do in order to defend itself. the possession of nuclear weapons is by its very nature offensive and cannot be viewed as defensive..

donald trump's child rape case allegations are credible.all of your points are invalid and are based off of feelings and opinion. there is no evidence of any of this other than so called "witnesses" where anyone now days can go around claiming rape. most rape case allegations are credible because they are real. patrick kane (a hockey player) was dropped of rape charges because, well simply, there was no rape. this comes with being famous and people will do anything to gain more publicity, so until i see actual evidence he is innocent until proven guilty, not guilty until proven innocent.

why gender is a social constructgender" is an idea that is based on what we socially believe. am i a woman because when i was a kid my female mother wanted me to play with dolls and not gi joes? of course, these social cues are what mainly divides men from women. men are supposed to be tough because society made them that way. women are weak because society made them that way. we're not born this way, we are made this way. anthropologists that have studied cultures around the world know that a lot of the traditional gender roles we see in the west are just products of culture and not necessarily innate. for the most part, culture forces people into behaving in certain ways. that said, almost all cultures do end up having gender roles that, whatever they are, align with physical sex in some way.

"white people" in america have an affirmative duty to combat systemic racism.i completely agree that neither white people nor black people are responsible for the individual acts of there members - a white person is not liable for the shootings in charleston any more than a black person is liable for the dc sniper shootings. instead i am arguing that when systemic and institutionalized problems exist within a group, like racism or extremism, members of that group have an affirmative duty to combat the source of those group-wide issues. in other words, i am arguing that because systemic racism exists within white culture and institutions, white people have a duty to engage their peers who contribute or encourage racism or they themselves are implicitly contributing to racism. similarly, it could be argued that christians and muslims have a duty to reach out to those misusing their faith or they too are contributing to the problem of extremism and hatred via their silence. for example, don't all catholics have an affirmative duty to combat pedophilia within the catholic church, since child molestation has been recognized as being a systemic problem within the church? having a duty to act to change group problems within a group differs from being responsible for the individual actions of members of a group. white people, like people of color, black people or religious groups, have a duty to combat group-wide problems that negatively impact society and their group's reputation. this is wholly distinguishable from holding the entire group responsible or liable for the actions of its members.

if you think that i should not walk near the swamp, then be ready to debate else do not answer.1.) a school van was driving without any details and indications that it was a school transport vehicle which was required by the law of my country (india). 2.) the school van was firstly driving at a wrong lane i.e. left side from where cars come inside the area, not go outside. 3.) it was driving at a high speed in a residential area where speed limit should be maintained as per law. 4.) it was driving at a high speed even though there were norms regarding school transport vehicles to maintain speed limit in my country. 5.) it was driving at a high speed even though there was a speed breaker which was again a violation of a state laws. 6.) even while crossing the speed breaker, it drove at a such a high speed that it splashed swamp on me and dirtied my clothes which could be avoided if it was driving slowly. 7.) i was walking on the footpath towards my home. when i reached near the speed-breaker, the school-van firstly went into the wrong lane, secondly did not slow-down in the speed-breaker, and thirdly, splashed swamp on me. now a stupid and a eunuch person teaches me that i should not have walked near the swamp, to which i gave such reasons that she (biologically born as a guy but since she is a eunuch therefore i addressed her as 'she') could not counter and proved herself to be stupid. do you think that i should not walk near a swamp? especially, if there is no choice available? if yes, then get ready for a debate. i will give the same reasons for which i gave to that eunuch which she could not counter!

gun ownership increases the risk of suicidethere is a correlation between the laxity of a country’s gun laws and its suicide rate – not because gun owners are more depressive, but because the means of quick and effective suicide is easily to hand. as many unsuccessful suicides are later glad that they failed in their attempt, the state should discourage and restrict the ownership of something that wastes so many human lives.

who is this man donald trumpthe question that i asked was,"who is this man donald trump," unfortunately we only have donald trump's rhetoric to guide us by and of course his personal history. but isn't this true of all politicians who run for office, that their political beliefs and personal character are assumed to be what the media and they themselves present them to be and the voters, as a consequence, have often been mislead into believing the politicians were one thing and then turned out to be the complete opposite of who they claimed to be. to offer proof of politicians deceiving the voters we only have to look at obama as a politician who practiced deception to get elected. obama made grandiose statements about "changes" that he would make if elected president. it has been said that ,"politician-speak has become so coded that it"s essentially another language...."author robert hutton. the sad facts are that we expect to be lied to by politicians and have become jaded to the point that no one expects honesty from our elected officials anymore. if donald trump is just another politician like all other politicians should we be surprised if this turns out to be true of him also. but perhaps donald trump would grow with the office of president to be an exceptional president as this quote suggests,""it"s not the position that makes the leader; it"s the leader that makes the position."

death penaltysince i have nothing to refute, i will address my opponent's first argument. i would like to note that it seems like my opponent simply added some "smart" sounding words to buff up her argument. "the death penalty honors human dignity by treating the defendant as a free moral actor able to control his own destiny for good or for ill" i do not see how killing someone allows the defendant to control his own destiny. "but communities would plunge into anarchy if they could not act on moral assumptions less certain than that the sun will rise in the east and set in the west." i agree, but this argument does virtually nothing to support the death penalty. my opponent has, in reality, done almost nothing to support the death penalty. i have no more to say, so i will sum up my arguments: 1. death penalty is very expensive 2. death penalty is unnecessary 3. death penalty can be regarded as mercy, putting the guilty "out of their misery" instead of making them sit in jail 4. death penalty goes against many religions 5. death penalty does not "scare" criminals out of doing bad things 6. death penalty is used randomly. it depends on the court, not the offense or crime that was committed 7. innocents have been executed wrongly 8. there are no benefits to death penalty and my opponent has failed to convince me otherwise by providing very vague arguments thank you for the debate.

gay marriagei shall argue against gay marriage: 1) gay marriage is not marriage simply calling a marriage a marriage does not mean it is a marriage. marriage always has been a covenant between man and woman. it is by nature that a marriage is to unify a man and a woman, not a woman and a woman or a man and a man. 2) gay marriage goes against nature. marriage serves two purposes: to unify and to procreate. a man and a man cannot create another human. only a man and a woman can do that. let me give you an analogy: say i have a chair. a chair, defined in a dictionary, is something used to sit on. that is the chair's nature. not to stand on or throw. standing on the chair or throwing the chair defeats the chair's purpose. you see, if you do anything else other than sit on the chair, you have a risk of breaking the chair or harming yourself. in a way, this chair is marriage. a marriage by nature is man and woman. anything other than that defeats its purpose and risks to damage the beauty of marriage. 3) gay marriage, even if right in society's eyes, are wrong morally. from a religious standpoint, it is morally wrong and against god's will to support gay marriage. this is not saying that being gay is wrong, in fact, it might a good thing. however, the gay acts are not. thank you for your time. this is all i will support for now.

government intervention runs too great a risk of building pro-government bias into the media; the very sector that should be independent of such biasit is simply a bad idea to have the media receive its funding from the very people it’s meant to be holding to account. even if it did not lead to actual bias, it would certainly lead to the suspicion of it. it is important that readers and viewers can have some degree of confidence that there is not even the suspicion of collusion. it is in the nature of things that the government would be less interested in getting stories put in than in getting inconvenient ones pulled. as a result consumers of the media would have no way of knowing whether collusion had taken place.

legalization of marijuanai oppose the legalization of marijuana, because of the high drug arrest in this country. i also oppose for te following reason: 1 marijuana is often used as a stepping-stone drug, leading to heroin, cocaine, or other harder drugs. 2 stoned driving and other dangers would be increased. 3 some consider use of the drug as morally wrong. 4 legalization would increase the chances of the drug falling into the hands of kids. 5 because of drug-related arrests, people who have committed or are likely to commit more serious crimes can be taken off the streets. 6physical damage would be done to users that abuse the drug. 7 more widespread use would increase the dangers of secondhand smoke-damage to bystanders. 8 legalization of marijuana could eventually lead to the legalization of harder drugs or all drugs altogether.

banning guns and gun control in the u.sthank you for contending! now many, which i gather you are one of, believe that banning guns will reduce crime rate and have great outcomes. however, this is not the case. by banning guns, you are only taking guns away from the law abiding citizens. lets take someone who is on the run from the police because they have robbed a bank. lets also suppose that the government has banned guns. they have already broken the law and decide that they will kill someone. if they have already broken a law, why do you think they would decide to follow the no guns law? now i know you may say that if guns were banned no one would be able to get control of guns. but i have current proof that this is not the case. meth is not a legal drug yet it is still used and up for purchase (black market). before marijuana was legalized in colorado, people were found using and owning marijuana. these are things that are banned and in marijuana's case controlled. does it look like criminals care whether or not it is banned? i await your reply, skeeter

the speed limit is a law and the law should be obeyed. you may believe you can drive safely above t...cameras are not sensitive to context. the speed limit is a guide to drives of the maximum safe speed, but circumstances vary, e.g. in the early morning with empty roads but good light the safe speed may be higher than the speed limit and a motorist exceeding a 50 mph limit by perhaps 5 mph poses no threat to the public and should not be penalised. at other times, for example in heavy rain, fog or when street lights have failed, the safe speed is much less than the set limit. emergency vehicles such as ambulances and fire trucks may need to break the limit on occasions, yet are often caught by cameras. promoting and enforcing one set speed in all circumstances is irresponsible as it will encourage drivers to ignore road conditions and so make the roads less safe.

marijuana legalizationthis is a four round debate. the first round is for presenting our positions, but the debate officially starts in round 2. i would prefer to debate this with someone who feels strongly about the position, and not just playing devil's advocate or semantics. this is my basic position, and will get into further detail pending my opponent's response. do not accept if you are only going to debate the specifics of my position rather than the overall legalization position. if your concern is regarding the personal preferences i set forth in my own hypothetical situation legalizing marijuana, then you are not truly against the legalization of marijuana. this is not a debate about degree of legalization, nor is it abut decriminalization vs. legalization. this debate is about the status quo vs. any form of legalization, liberalization, or reform of marijuana laws in favor of non-violent users. thank you. 1- marijuana should be legal in small quantities (3 oz. or less) for personal use to responsible adults over the age of 21. 2- marijuana should be considered for medicinal purposes for a variety of illnesses including, but not limited to depression, fibromyalgia, scoliosis, crohn's disease, hiv, aids, patients on chemotherapy, migraines, insomnia, and others. 3- marijuana should be taxed and regulated by the individual states, and proceeds from taxation should be used to fund treatment for drug abuse, studies for alternative medicines like marijuana, youth education programs, etc. 4- the growth of marijuana for personal use should not be considered a crime. 5- means of legal acquirement of marijuana should be established with federal protection so that those which follow their state laws need not be worried about federal prosecution. i await my opponent's introduction, and hope this turns out to be an informative debate for all.

more guns mean more homicide, more gun control leads to less homicideit is stupid to think that disarming innocent people will somehow protect innocent people, it is already illegal for felons to own guns, so whatever felons do have guns are doing so illegally, and a gun ban won’t affect them very much. so felons are just as armed as before, except maybe more because when you ban something you create a whole new market for it, while law abiding citizens are disarmed. this is supposed to reduce crime how? liberals would point to brittan having fewer homicides than we do, about 4 times less proportional to their population. but correlation is not causation, just because i can find a place where guns are illegal that has a lower crime rate than one where they are legal doesn’t prove anything because hat nation where guns are illegal might otherwise have a lower crime rate. you are also picking up the nation with the highest crime rate of those nations where guns are legal and comparing it to the nation with the lowest crime rate of those nations where guns are illegal. you have to compare very nation where guns are legal to those where they are illegal, and compare times with higher gun ownership to those with less gun ownership in the same nation. which gives you the following statistics,

given that the smallest of the strategic nuclear weapons the us has is powerful enough to obliterate...the problem with a deterrence program based around the idea that you have to convince your enemies that you are capable of using nuclear weapons, is that it makes you more likely to actually use nuclear weapons. the january 2002 nuclear posture review made it clear that the us should change the way it viewed nuclear weapons as different from other arms, and integrate nuclear with non-nuclear tactical weaponry. yet a moral stigma has been associated with nuclear weaponry since hiroshima and nagasaki, meaning that world leaders have been desperate not to use them - so they are different. with the world’s only superpower breaking the nuclear taboo, they lose any moral leverage they have over countries who do not have nuclear weaponry but are seeking to acquire it.\ even worse, states like north korea and iran can justifiably see the development of mini-nukes as an aggressive step by the us to develop weapons designed for use against them, thus giving them a greater justification for developing their own nuclear weapons in response.\ the us should remember that nuclear weapons are the great leveller: a state like iran will never have the funds or technology to match the conventional weaponry that the us can bring to bear, but with just one nuclear weapon all that conventional weaponry becomes almost irrelevant. the more states which feel the nuclear taboo has been broken or that they are under threat from the usa, the more states that will develop their own nuclear weapons and the less able the us will be to use its conventional forces as a genuine deterrent. \

the bible is a reliable historical document.unfortunately, i feel this debate is going to boil down to the existence of god because much of the bible consists of claims which are physically impossible. animals speak in several instances in the bible, the first being the adam and eve story. in order for historians to generally consider a document a reliable historical guide, it needs to first abide by the rules of nature. if there was an account in the civil war of amputees growing back limbs, there is no doubt that this document would be looked upon with severe skepticism. perhaps some theists could have a different perspective of this phenomenon, but even if there were several eyewitnesses this is not enough to confirm the event. if one has an "extended" view of the laws of nature and reality, then i really don't know how to argue against that person besides debating their core premises that make up this reality. perhaps this debate was better left to a christian or a jew with a different perception of the bible. frankly, if i truly believed in any of the impossible events listed in the bible then i would have much less of an obstacle in terms of believing in the rest, and in that sense i understand you. do you seriously take the creation myth literally? i know this is an obvious criticism (damn science) but it does seem to boil down to faith.

white privilege existswhile it may not be obvious white people do have more privileges than minorities, just think about white people are the majority the rest are minorities. though don't get me wrong white people can experience racism, just saying that white people can't experience racism is racist within itself. but to get back on topic there have been studies that have shown that white people are more likely to get jobs than minorities.

religion only causes harmmy opponent continues to not grasp my position. he thinks i am saying that religion makes charity bad. i am not saying that at all, i am saying that attaching religion to charity makes it worse then it would have been if it had not been attached to nonsensical ideas. remember religion as defined is a set of ideas, not just one. my opponent continues to commit the fallacy of composition over and over again. he points out that charity is good and asserts that the set must be good. i on the other hand have argued that forcing charity into a set of other ideas that are both good and bad, is harmful because it would be better to allow charity to stand on its own merits. i don't think my opponent is grasping this. its this simple: i give a college student a bag of presents, here is what is in the bag: text books for his next set of classes, a e-card for the caf, and a uncaged angry gaboon viper. if i asked if the present was overall good, it would be a no, as the uncaged gaboon viper being wrapped up in the deal makes it worse then it would have been had that gaboon viper not been included. including unnecessary bad things into a package always brings it down compared to what it would have been if you allowed the person to accept each one on his own.

the media is liberally biasedwith all respects, you shouldn't believe everything you hear or just because it got published somewhere. in my opinion, this piece (which to be honest, looks copy and pasted, and totally devoid of your own opinions) does you no favors. here are my reasons: 1. the time frame studied seems to be from 1990 to 2003. that was 12 years ago. how do i know things haven't changed since then? maybe some of the media outlets is under new management? what about online media? does it account for those? the scale it uses is based off the opinions of actual people. i'm pretty sure the political office make-up has changed since then. 2. this article does seem to be written by people knowledgeable in the field so likely when they mean conservative and liberal, they mean the actual definitions of conservatism and liberalism, neither of which really stem from the "establishment" which is how you defined them. 3. in the article, although it only gives 2 media outlets that are classified as right-centrist, it hardly means that the media is "liberally" biased. this kind of ties in with the first point but how i do know there aren't other media outlets that just aren't being listed? also, perhaps i just misunderstand you but to me, a liberally biased media would mean that all outlets would have to give a more liberal perspective vs a conservative perspective. here, with this article i feel you're just trying to say that the number of liberal media outlets outnumber the number of conservatives which again may not be true. maybe the authors themselves are just liberals... look forward to your reply.

"mainstream media" is defined for this debate as the news sources from which the majority of americans get their news, including printed sources, cable/tv news, radio, and the internet. "liberal bias" will be defined as a tendency to present news stories with the agenda of elevating policies or stances that are conventionally called liberal. this may be in the form of excluding or distorting information to serve this goal, as well as devoting time to certain issues or politicians unevenly. taking the con stance, i will argue that the mainstream media does not have a liberal bias, or at least that any liberal biases it exhibits do not overcompensate for any conservative biases it exhibits. my opponent will presumably argue that liberal bias in the media does in fact outweigh conservative bias.

the people have no control over the mediayou mentioned that the casey anthony story didn't blow up by other news channels until after the fact. without the media those other places wouldn't even know about casey anthony and her child. therefore, the media had control of what was being put out and viewed. 1.) in noam chomsky's manufacturing consent, he explains the government control over the media. he says that media works as a business that uses control to allow what is put out into the public. the government wants a steady and non-chaotic system to the media and wouldn't want anyone to lash out against them. there are three elements in this theory: a covert goal, a deception strategy, and a manipulated outcome. during wwii the nazi party took over the media. they controlled what was viewed, said, and done. they did not allow anyone to go against what they wanted to be brought out to the people. the theory explains that the government must present illusions to certain media so there is no chaos. they produce stories that will interest all in order to get money. the theory states that the people have no control over the media they are viewing. some of it may not be the full information either. the government can control what is being put out there for their own benefit by profit or because they don't think the public should know.

the news media is biased against the positive aspects of gun ownershipround 1 is for acceptance, round 4 is for rebuttals. since most debates about gun control end up devolving into an argument on the semantics of the 2nd amendment i'd like to engage a fresh perspective. the issue mentioned in the title is key to the reason why so much negative public perception is directed at guns, and thus why many people shudder at the thought of unrestricted gun ownership. the position i am taking is that the media, while not always intentionally, has shown a clear bias in reporting stories that convey the negatives of gun usage and ownership. simultaneously, they have failed to give the same treatment towards the stories which exhibit the positives of everyday citizens using guns. my opponent should be of the position that the media fairly covers both the positive and negative occurrences of gun usage, with no inherent bias towards either side. keep in mind: this is not a debate about the second amendment or its legitimacy. the only topic for discussion here is the news coverage of gun-related incidents. i eagerly await a willing opponent.

that the united states should implement universal health care modeled after the french systemto wrap up this debate what i'm trying to prove is that we should adopt universal health care modeled after the french because as i have stated earlier that we have a 2.3 trillion debt due to health care and france has a 9 billion dollar deficit do you can clearly see the difference between the two and i do agree with my opponent that we would go bankrupt with this universal health care but what i'm also trying to say is that even if we don't take in the universal health care we still would be going bankrupt. but by taking in universal health care we wouldn't go into bankrupt so quickly. my second point is that it could be possible to work universal health care in the united states, in kentucky they had done a similar thing like universal health care but they stated it did not work due to the low number of citizens. so if we were to take in universal health care which would include every one then we could possibly work universal health care into our system this are my two main points on why i should win this debate thank you masterzanzibar for such a great debate no one has ever bring up this kind of information and you should tell me what framework has to do with this debate

there should not be any type of ban on abortionfirst of all, i'd like to welcome dxpilot to this debate. i would first like to state that, there are many reasons there should not be a ban on abortion. first of all, it is the mother's choice, and the mother's choice alone. simple as that. post-abortion guilt. these effects do not always take place. suppose a woman got raped, and she was worried about the child she was to have. she could, very easily, feel relief in getting an abortion, knowing that there will not be any other long-term effects. although this seems a bit immoral, i do not think a growing fetus should be considered a human. just like an apple seed should not be considered an apple tree. and although this seems just as immoral, it is not an independet creature. it lives much like a parisite, living off of it's host. some may say that, when a pregnant mother is killed, it is counted as double murder. and because of this, there should be a ban, right? wrong. it has often been proven that medical laws and procedures, can very much differ from the laws upheld in the courtroom. prove me wrong.

law against racismi'd like to open up by pointing out that i'm not against racism. i am starting this debate to get the hang of the topic so soon i can make one for the position i fully stand behind. with that being said you (con) also do not have to be a racist to debate back. i'd also like to point out that by "racism" i'm more specifically referring to caucasian towards black. i am fully aware that black people can also be racists and that there are other ethnicity's that are discriminated but i'd like to only talk about black. my opening argument: black people have been discriminated against for centuries. they have been used as slaves and segregated. racism is rude, insensitive and hurtful. not only does it harm people's feelings, but can also cause a certain friction between races of which can lead to a full out war. what happened in ferguson serves as proof that prejudice between a cop and a black citizen led to riots. a law that made prejudice illegal, meaning that people could no longer use racial slurs or express themselves in a way that could be harmful to a black person would make it so intrigues caused by those terms or behaviors would benefit society by making it so no one would get emotionally hurt and preventing fights.

glass bottles should replace plastic bottleshere are my reasons 1. glass bottles are easier to clean and will not be thrown away easily. people will throw away plastic bottles after using, that's a waste. 2. some of the plastic bottles are made with polycarbonate plastic. polycarbonate plastic is now known to leach a compound called bisphenol a, or bpa, a chemical that mimics estrogen in the body and thus may cause developmental hormonal disruptions in young children.

ban plastic bags in grocery storestrue, but if we throw away paper it is a lot better, for the simple fact that look at what is making all these paper bags. i mean these bags are basically made out of high polyethylene and not to mention they are harmful to children. the reusable bags that are mentioned take more to make and more money, so basically we are spending more tax money making the reusable bags more than anything, but reusable bags are less harmful to the environment so i give you that one. good luck!!!

abortion should be legalabortion should be legal because if a woman doesn't want to have a child than she should have the right to prevent herself from having one. if the government bans abortion then they would be forcing a woman to have a child. if a pregnant woman doesn't have an abortion then she is going to have a child. so if the government takes away that right then pregnant women will have no choice but to have a child. adoption is a option that is not used often after a woman gives birth to a child. most women don't want to put their child up for adoption. if the government bans abortion then some women will have an unsafe abortion. more women will have an unsafe abortion if abortion is illegal. every year approximately 78,000 women die from unsafe abortion. if abortion is legal then less unsafe abortions will occur. abortion is a safe medical procedure. 88% of women who have an abortion do so in their first trimester. medical abortions have less than 0.5% risk of serious complications and do not affect a woman's health or future ability to become pregnant or give birth. the government should make sure that late term abortion is safe. the fetus is in the woman's body so therefore the government should not control their bodies. banning abortion is bad for women and is anti-women's rights.

the united states should implement universal health care modeled after the french system.thank you for accepting this debate, and good luck. there are several flaws in my opponent's argument, which i will attack in this round. rebuttal: one flaw is that "billy" could not afford health insurance and needed free universal health care. universal health care is not actually "free". the way the government funds universal health care is through taxes. every worker in france pays about 50% of their paycheck each month into health care. if the united states had universal health care, billy would not be able to even afford food, and it would be unfair to the u.s. as a whole because every worker would have half as much money, and would also be paying for other people. secondly, is the idea that he got turned away from the hospital. that would be impossible, as it is illegal for a hospital to refuse emergency medical service due to a lack of insurance or money. even so, billy could have received free treatment from a non-profit or government-run hospital.

pascal's wager is true.alright. thank you for challenging me on this issue. if i am to proceed with arguing against pascal's wager it is necessary for me to state that i will not be attacking the existence or non-existence of god, but the viability of pascal's wager. pascal's wager can be defined that it is in one's own best interest to behave as if god exists, since the possibility of eternal punishment in hell outweighs any advantage of believing otherwise. if god does exist and you believe he existed, there will be an infinite gain for you (eternal peace - heaven). if you did not believe he existed when he actually does, there will be an infinite loss for you (eternal suffering - hell). if god does not exist and you believed he did exist, there is only a finite loss (a tangible loss only for yourself) and if you did not believe god exists when god does not exist, then there is a finite gain (a tangible gain only for yourself). now i will be arguing against the latter claims of pascal's wager. the idea of there being only a finite gain or loss from disbelief is absolutely absurd on the the basis of three premises; 1) what if the god (or gods) of a different theism existed? in other words, what if you had belief or disbelief in the wrong god? 2) what if the god that does exist, is not the god which we think to exist within the deisms and theisms man has created? 3) there is no possible way to have a memory or waking experience of death or life after death, so understanding if you, in fact, gained or lost in a finite or infinite manner, would be impossible to comprehend in our live's waking conscious.

gay marriage should be legal.i am not advocating for the government to tell the church what to do. legalizing gay marriage does not command the church to act in one way or another, it only requires the government to permit gay marriages to be granted -by the government. marriage, as an institution, is subject to tremendous governmental regulation -at present by individual states. it is taxed, subsidized, incentivized, and even defined -by every state other than ma and a few others, as between man and one woman. it is that definition, and only that definition, that legalizing gay marriage will change. legalizing gay marriage will permit one man to marry another man, or one woman to marry another woman -as the government recognizes marriage. wether the church should desire to perform gay marriage, endorse gay marriage, or support the practice of gay marriage is a matter entirely for the church to sort out. while it was originally the case that marriage was a religious thing, it is more than that now. that it was once only a religious thing does not mean that it has not transcended its origins. christmas is celebrated by atheists, just as much as non-religious people get married (even if they are straight). as to the health insurance effects of gay marriage, i'm not sure it is appropriate to be discussing the finite details of intercourse on this medium and so i will abstain from doing so. i will only say that there are exceptionally effective means to prevent the spread of disease that are readily available at any pharmacy, grocery store, or gas station.

nuclear weapons are required for deterrencethe use of nuclear weapons would indeed be a great tragedy; but so, to a greater or lesser extent, is any war. the reason for maintaining an effective nuclear arsenal is in fact to prevent war. by making the results of conflict catastrophic, a strategic deterrent discourages conflict. the cold war was in fact one of the most peaceful times in history, particularly in europe, largely because of the two superpowers' nuclear deterrents: ‘the principal function of nuclear weapons was to deter nuclear attack’ (record, 2004). during the gulf war, for example, one of the factors which prevented iraq from launching missiles tipped with chemical weapon warheads against israel was the threat the usa would retaliate with a nuclear strike. although there is no longer as formal a threat of retaliation as there was during the cold war, the very possibility that the use of nuclear weapons by a rogue state could be met a retaliatory strike is too great a threat to ignore. moreover, although the citizens of the current nuclear powers may be against the use of force against civilians, their opinions would rapidly change if they found weapons of mass destruction being used against them.

why abortion should be bannedwhat about the trauma rape victims go through? rape victims often get ptsd from their ordeal. being pregnant and knowing you must deliver a baby you had no consent in making puts a lot of stress on the rape victim. it adds to the trauma. rape is not a good thing, even if a baby comes out of it. another thing is that women aren't entirely helpless. they take precautions. some are black belts and others carry pepper spray or a gun. and why should we penalize women for being the victim? another thing is that banning abortion will not stop it, just like how the prohibition act did not stop alcohol. the only thing an abortion ban will stop is safe abortions. women who do not want a baby will still try it on themselves, without the help of a doctor. and trying abortion without a doctor is extremely risky. this could not just kill the baby, but it's dangerous to the woman as well. it could end up killing them both, or even worse, keeping the baby alive, but horribly deform it.

glass bottles should replace plastic bottlesyou can't say use aluminium, you have chosen to use glass to replace plastic bottles. cans and bottles are nearly same. plastic can be recycled and reused, glass once broken isn't reusable. plastic is more durable than glass. tap water needs to be boiled in certain areas to be drinkable, which would increase fuel consumption. plus, plastic bottles can't be used as a weapon, but glass bottles can shed blood. glass can reflect light and cause distraction, plastic can't. overall, vote for con

fake rape case is a lethal weapon for womencounter-arguments: "women are not at all being punished for these fake rape accusations, is the thing to which i am against. i again say that they should be severely punished as much as the particular man has suffered in every case" women should be punished equally on that matter, however again fake rape allegations can be a lethal weapon for women, like how any trial can be. you entirely ignore the fact i laid out that in mdcs and ndcs fake rape allegations are very few. "but for now, since it is not punishable, these women are not afraid of the law" i hate to stress my point further, but women will be more afraid of the law in more developed countries where there are greater penalties for false rape allegations. "since you said the biased rules are necessary for protection of women, i say then why not make gender neutral laws" never did i say these "biased rules" were necessary for the protection of women, i only said that society will form itself based on what the people make of it, these "biased rules" were created to discourage men from raping women, sexual harassment, stalking, etc. arguments: like i've said before, these biased rules are made to fit the paths society is taking. if a country faces inflation, effort will be put forth to stop inflation, if a country faces massive crime, effort will be put forth to stop inflation, so on and so forth. false rape allegations are much more "lethal" and likely to succeed in countries that have recently developed or less developed, you continuously ignore this. false rape allegations can be a lethal weapon for women.

the existence of godi believe in the existence of a god, and con will have to argue otherwise. this will not be a religious debate about which religion (or lack thereof) is right, it is purely about the concept of god. with that being said, i will use (and con may also use) examples from religions to prove or disprove god's existence. for example, con may argue that god doesn't exist because christianity says so and so, but if i bring a counterargument from judaism, and in a later round refute judaism and bring an argument from christianity then that is completely fine because the debate aims purely to prove or disprove god's existence, nothing more and nothing less. the debate structure is as follows: r1-acceptance and basic argument as to why god does not exist. r2-r4-arguments r5-conclusion/no new arguments i look forward to this debate.

the government should abolish death penaltyi feel that if someone who has done a mass murder and taken into custody and let lose by given bail, i think it is not right to let lose a criminal.he might still commit some crime and still kill some more people.why should we leave people who have committed serious crimes and let them out of jail by giving them bail?people say that in india it is easier to get bail than bhel poori(a chaat dish)at a restaurant.they say that if we kill the killer, we are no less than the killer.so the best thing to do is to get the criminals hanged to death instead of providing them with all the facilities in jail. the government should not abolish death penalty and must be strict and bring the criminals to justice by hanging them and not grant them bail at all.as i said ,the problem in india is that you get bail very easily.anybody reading this shall try to answer for this argument but you can also you can support me with my debate.it is open to all and please respond to this debate with good rebuttal.

nuclear weapons should not be abolished if you could abolish them.i am a little saddened that my opponent didn't respond in round two, i already clearly stated my rebuttals and reasons. i guess the only thing left for me to do now is summarized my points. nuclear weapon have many uses such as emps, interceptors, and airburst. i have demonstrated that harm cause by them is equivalent to the harm done by non-nuclear weapons. i have shown that nuclear weapons are the best way to prevent life on earth from getting destroyed by an asteroid, by using nuclear weapons to deflect the asteroid. i have shown that abolishing nuclear weapons would not end the arms race but only revitalise it with an arms race for the strongest thermobaric weapons. in the end abolishing nuclear weapons provides no advantage for the world, and will instead increase the likelihood of its destruction.

the government should abolish death penaltyas i believe that government internationally should abolish capital punishment; i will accept this debate. india's economy is not something i am familiar with; therefore there's no economic argument that i can relatively debate with accuracy. however, i believe there are several other logical arguments for the abolishment of death penalty. 1. prison life is worse than death to justify that prison is worse than death, my opponent will need to understand the goal of prison. prison takes away all rights to members of society; and takes away the one thing that the death penalty can not. a will to live. the death penalty is an easy way out, a free of guilt option to many prisoners. prison life gives prisoners the chance to feel the suffering and loss of something that the family or friends of the criminals victims feel. whether it be robbery, murder, rape or any other serious crime; prison can be much more effective. not to mention the abuse of many prisoners.

religion is evidence of man's ignorancealthough science has made many advances toward our understanding of the physical nature of the universe, this doesn't mean that religion will fade away as a result. religion is not necessarily in opposition to science. science is a way for us to test the physical world around us using a method that relies on strictly on the tangible nature of the universe. religion on the other hand has more to do with a spiritual understanding of one's self. a person does not necessarily join a religion in order to understand the universe but more to help guide themselves toward happiness or enlightenment of some sort. religion is very abstract and comes in many different forms. it is very similar to art in the sense that it is completely subjective to the individual's taste and does not necessarily rely on the outside world. that being said, religion has many benefits toward a person and their growth. just about every religion encourages love and caring for others. following a religion has nothing to do with a person's ignorance. there are many knowledgeable and wise people who follow religions and there are many ignorant people who don't. in the past, religions tended to be anthropomorphic and the gods were flawed and human like. as we evolved, religion became more abstract and grew as our scientific understanding grew. most religions today tend to be monotheistic or pantheistic but there are even some atheistic religions out there. as we grow, the religions we know today will fade but new ones will sprout.
