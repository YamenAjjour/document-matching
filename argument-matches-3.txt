america should support blanket amnesty for illegal immigrants.the solution to illegal immigration is not to grant aliens the same rights as united states citizens or immigrants who are here legally. according to the federation for american immigration reform, illegal immigration costs taxpayers $113 billion every year, which amounts to an extra $1,117 per household ("illegal immigration"american taxpayer"). illegal immigrants do pay taxes, but this only yields $13 billion per year, leaving a net cost of $100 billion that must be made up by law-abiding citizens. ("illegal immigration"american taxpayer"). illegal immigration is clearly unhealthy for america. in fact, the money spent on education and welfare programs for illegal aliens exceeded the budget deficits of 18 states in 2009 ("illegal immigration"american taxpayer"). if a "path to citizenship" were granted, tax revenues from current illegal aliens would certainly increase. however, this yield would be greatly exceeded by the cost of the full welfare benefits to which they would automatically become entitled ("illegal immigration"american taxpayer"). therefore, illegal immigration should be discouraged so that the u.s. can dig itself out of its fiscal grave and first provide law-abiding citizens with the care they need. works cited "illegal immigration: the $113 billion dollar drain on the american taxpayer." illegal immigration statistics. 2013. web. 18 october 2013. http://www.illegalimmigrationstatistics.org....

government intervention runs too great a risk of building pro-government bias into the media; the very sector that should be independent of such biasignoring the fact, as already mentioned, that the government already subsidizes the media, it is routine for media outlets to report bad news on advertisers.  admittedly in the case of minor stories it might have some impact but in the case of a major story the associated increase in circulation and the effect that can have on rates charged to other advertisers in future more than compensates. additionally, as all liberal democratic states contain multiple media outlets, the likelihood of all of them agreeing to supress a story- in what is a fantastically competitive market- is essentially nil. indeed, letting the editor of a newspaper know that all of his rivals had decided not to run a story would seem to be a sure fire way of guaranteeing that he would put it on the front page. competition between advertisers and outlets solves this problem neatly.

america should support blanket amnesty for illegal immigrants.citizens are more likely than illegal immigrants to commit crimes, but aliens still contribute to the imperative issue of criminality in america. one is more likely to die from a car accident than from drowning, but does that mean swimming safety should be taken any less seriously? in 2011, the u.s. immigration and customs enforcement removed 396,000 people from this country, the highest number ever, and fifty-five percent of them were convicted criminals ("republicans...crimes"). therefore, illegal immigrants cannot be granted the rights of citizens because it would only encourage unrestrained immigration and an increase in the crime rate. the threat that amnesty poses to national security should also be considered. the majority of terrorist acts committed in the united states have been perpetrated by people from countries abroad. granting illegal immigrants amnesty would "open the flood gates," relaxing our immigration policies even further and increasing the risk of terrorism ("top ten pros and cons"). the highly reputable center for immigration studies predicts that, as the requirements for citizenship become easier to obtain, immigrants will create false documents just to obtain green cards or amnesty, heightening the risk of terrorists slipping through the cracks ("is it...illegal immigrants?"). the risk that illegal immigrants pose to the safety of american citizens cannot be undermined, and granting them amnesty would only put the country's safety in jeopardy. works cited "is it a bad idea to legalize the illegal immigrants?" illegal immigration statistics. 2013. web. 21 october 2013. http://www.illegalimmigrationstatistics.org.......

religions do the world more bad than goodthank you for accepting my debate. so, i will start with this link here: http://www.lesbian-crushes-and-bulimia.com... if you go to that site, you will see many quotations from the bible about how homosexuals should be put to death. since i respect homosexuals and think they are natural (here is a link to sustain my argument: http://www.exposingtruth.com... ) i obviously can't accept this. as you can see, a religious book is punishing something natural with death. this leads to discrimination from true bible believers, and is obviously unacceptable. this is a way in which religion is damaging society. take, for example, the islamic state. no matter how wrong their interpretation is, it is still an interpretation, and wouldn't exist without the religion in the first place. the crusades are another example; they put thousands to death just to get their holy city back. moving on, some say religions build morals, but i disagree. buddhism, which, if you look closely is not a religion, but a philosophy, has morals even without the belief in god (and no buda was not a god). besides, what kind of morals does religion sustain in the first place? back to the first link, christianity is saying something natural is immoral, even though it obviously isn't. (here is a link on things the christian god did that i find unacceptable [as well as bible mistakes]: http://www.evilbible.com... ) and just because someone is not religious, doesn't mean that person doesn't love or care about others, so obviously religions are unnecessary to achieve morality. i could continues but have decided to continue gradually in my other rounds after i see what you are aiming at. thank you again.

the united states should abolish the death penaltythe death penalty is counter productive because in a criminal justice system like the united states people are bound to slip through the cracks who did not commit a crime, and be executed for a crime they didn't commit. legal experts and statisticians from michigan and pennsylvania used the latest techniques to produce a peer reviewed (that is very important for validity) study that showed that at least 4.1% of people who were given the death penalty since the 1970's were later proven as well as anything can be proven to be innocent. this is an impressive figure, because what this shows that, if the point of the death penalty is retribution for families of victims of murder, the death penalty is counter productive when people innocent of that crime are executed. keep in mind, if you are pro death penalty you are accepting that some people who were innocent will slip through the cracks. article:http://www.theguardian.com... study the article was based on: http://www.pnas.org... on top of the counter productivity, i have heard the argument that the death penalty actually costs less than a life sentence, but this is false on every front. 1) until some one is finally executed the regular prison price is being paid while they are on death row, meaning a death penalty does not get rid of the prison cost. 2)it costs $2,000,000 to $5,000,000 in tax revenue for each death penalty case for trials and appeals, while for an entire 40 years in prison it costs $1,000,000-$1,250,000. so the death penalty is much more expensive than a life sentence. http://okcadp.org...

universal healthcare systems are inefficientone of the countries lauded for its universal health care is france. so what has the introduction of universal coverage brought the french? costs and waiting lists. france’s system of single-payer health coverage goes like this: the taxpayers fund a state insurer called assurance maladie, so that even patients who cannot afford treatment can get it. now although, at face value, france spends less on healthcare and achieves better public health metrics (such as infant mortality), it has a big problem. the state insurer has been deep in debt since 1989, which has now reached 15 billion euros.[1] another major problem with universal health care efficiency is waiting lists. in 2006 in britain it was reported that almost a million britons were waiting for admission to hospitals for procedures. in sweden the lists for heart surgery are 25 weeks long and hip replacements take a year. very telling is a ruling by the canadian supreme court, another champion of universal health care: “access to a waiting list is not access to health care”.[2] universal health coverage does sound nice in theory, but the dual cancers of costs and waiting lists make it a subpar option when looking for a solution to offer americans efficient, affordable and accessible health care.

high speed rail is better than air travelcurrently intercity travel within the u.s. tends to favour air travel. this is often due to the large distances between cities within the u.s. which mean that driving is not a viable strategy should there be time constraints on travel. however, air travel has significant constraints as well such as long boarding times. this causes problems for those people who frequently commute and high speed rail is set to solve these problems. high speed rail provides a large number of significant benefits over air travel in this regard. this is because high speed rail can travel to city centres. where airports, due to their size and the noise pollution they cause, are limited to the outskirts of a city, trains are not limited in the same way. as such, people can arrive in a much more central area, cutting large amounts of time off their journey. secondly, high speed rail has no limits on wireless communication or internet in the same way that air travel does. as such, high speed rail is significantly more useful for anyone who wishes to work on the journey. finally, the weather is incredibly problematic for air travel. this is especially true in the u.s. where a number of areas can be subject to unexpected snow or storms. by comparison, high speed rail remains comparatively unhindered.[1] [1] “convenience of high speed rail.” us high speed rail association. http://www.ushsr.com/benefits/convenience.html

the bible is unreliableresolution: the bible is unreliable. once i find a single way why that is not a valid statement i must be awarded the victory. let me remind you of that. to prove that the bible is unreliable you must discredit all other reasons why it could be reliable. 1. my opponent has conceded to the fact that the bible is physically reliable. this is no longer a point of debate and is a mutual agreement. since the bible as agreed by both debaters is physically reliable this discredits the resolution "the bible is unreliable" this is in agreement from pro and means he has discredited his own resolution. my opponent has not discredited the reason.2. it is supposed to prove that within the same version the message is the same and words are similar. which makes it a reliable source and it will not differentiate much. my opponent only questioned this and did not attack it.3. actually he hurts himself here. again to show how reliable the good ol bible is we see it can provide a reliable laugh too. again, he hasn't attacked this. even though i have not attacked any contentions i have more than a plethora of reasons why the resolution is false.

the bible is reliablethe bible is very contradictive. for example, god ordered the israelites to go to war with other nations and kill those who committed crimes(samuel 15:3 & joshua 4:13). but then other verses tell us, "you shall not murder" and "whoever takes a human life shall surely be put to death". the bible itself is very confusing and takes alot of time and work to fully understand it. "basically, my contention is that the bible was transmitted accurately which makes it reliable. even if some of the stories in the bible sounds too good to be true it does not mean it was not transmitted accurately"how do you know? there are other books out there that claim they're based on true stories. most of these stories even have a mythical fantasy beast that sounds too good to be true. but according to you, just because it sounds too good to be true, doesn't mean it's not real. for example, the quran, a book used by muslims. the quran is nearly as old as the bible and it's followers claim that there is no solid evidence to prove the quran has ever been altered/editied. but, the quran is a book very different from ours. it rules are very different and they worship differently. so why don't we just believe in the quran since it too was transmitted accurately and sounds too good to be true.[sources]http://www.gotquestions.org...

america should support blanket amnesty for illegal immigrants.undocumented workers do not receive full social security benefits because they are not united states citizens " nor should they be until they seek citizenship legally. illegal immigrants are legally obligated to pay taxes, and they owe the government for allowing them to live and work in this country. one must remember that, whatever their reasons, immigrants who have come to this country without legal documentation have broken the law. just as criminals lose their rights when they break the law, so should illegal immigrants have to face the consequences of their actions. granting illegal immigrants the same rights as citizens would encourage them continue to break the law instead of seeking the approved path to citizenship ("is it...illegal immigrants?"). obama's plan to grant amnesty to illegal immigrants involves awarding visas to immigrants who have waited patiently in their countries of origin and to those who broke the law to come here ("is it...illegal immigrants?"). if we award illegal immigrants legal rights, then we are essentially condoning crime. furthermore, it is inaccurate to assume that illegal immigrants are not benefiting from living in this country already - even without full social security benefits. for example, money sent home by illegal immigrants is one of mexico"s largest sources of revenue after oil sales and exports ("top ten pros and cons"). this revenue drains money away from the millions of unemployed and poor americans who need help, and proves once again that illegal immigrants should not automatically be granted legal rights and receive the same benefits as citizens. works cited "is it a bad idea to legalize the illegal immigrants?" illegal immigration statistics. 2013. web. 21 october 2013. http://www.illegalimmigrationstatistics.org....

should marijuana be legalized for recreational usei'm for marijuana to be legalized for recreational use, because marijuana can be as dangerous as "food" that we put into our body's. most people are scared of marijuana and parents, grandparents and other adults tell us that marijuana can kill us. first if alcohol and cigarettes are legal then why marijuana can't be legal too. alcohol affects on people are scary and unhealthy. people with alcohol addiction are unstoppable they can't control their actions and because of this many life's were lost even of innocent people. to ppurchase marijuana legally you need to visit places like washington or colorado to buy a joint, which is far safer then a bottle of vodka. i have seen the affect on people when they are drunk and when they are high, so i rather see high person walking on the street chasing birds, then shouting young man with a vodka or bear bottle in their hands.second marijuana can be used in medical world, as it shows good potential. once i had broken my chest and experience is not the best. pain killers never helped, but as i know marijuana can be used to stop that pain for good. marijuana can even help in other situations like: mitigates multiple sclerosis and tourette syndrome symptoms, and may reduce dystonia. so if marijuana is so bad and its a devils gift to world why some countries, states allow it, maybe its not that bad after and some people should stop worrying about marijuana and start looking how it could help us.

vaccinations should be mandatoryvaccines should not mandatory as: 1) they do not guarantee 100% protection from the disease. the efficiency of the vaccines can depend on various factors such age, health, sex etc, the efficiency of vaccines is usually between 60% to 80%. http://www.nvic.org... 2) vaccines are not very safe, many vaccines contain mercury which is directly entered into our blood stream. that could lead to mercury poisoning. http://en.wikipedia.org... 3) everyone is different, so a vaccine which might work for one individual may or may not work for the other. in some cases these vaccines can have a severe allergic reaction, which in rare cases lead to death. http://articles.mercola.com... even after taking the vaccines the person may or may not get exposed to the disease, let us assume that at the very least the vaccines are 50% efficient, and from those people who are vaccinated 50% of them are exposed to the disease at the most, since the vaccine is only 50 % efficient half of those people will benefit. if you do the maths here, we can see that 75% of the people who take the vaccine do not benefit from it, they simply suffer the side effects. so it should be clearly the peoples choice, if they would want to risk taking the vaccine or leave it. thus vaccines should never be made mandatory.
