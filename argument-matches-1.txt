abolish the death penaltyin my opinion the death penalty in the united states should be abolished because of its current extreme financial costs and the possibility of accidently executing innocents. executing criminals is not worth it if the cost of doing so is radically more than simply confining them for life and the chance of mistakenly executing an innocent. dna evidence has already proven some thought to be criminals as innocent. new inventions in technology may also free innocents as dna technology has, but if they have already been executed it is too late for them to freed. the small deterrence effect of the death penalty is nowhere near effective enough to justify the financial cost of the death penalty in the united states nor the possibility of executing innocent civilians. report of the california commission on the fair administration of justice (2008) "using conservative rough projections, the commission estimates the annual costs of the present (death penalty) system to be $137 million per year. the cost of the present system with reforms recommended by the commission to ensure a fair process would be $232.7 million per year. the cost of a system in which the number of death-eligible crimes was significantly narrowed would be $130 million per year. the cost of a system which imposes a maximum penalty of lifetime incarceration instead of the death penalty would be $11.5 million per year." - http://www.deathpenalty.org...

death penaltyfirst, the death penalty is very expensive. in fact, more expensive than keeping the criminal in prison for life. in 2011, it was found that california spent a whopping $4 billion on capital punishment. this money could have been used to help the families of the victims instead of killing the offender. the death penalty goes against many religions who regard it as immoral. a study has shown that death penalty plays virtually no role in deterring criminals. finally, one of the most obvious points, innocent people have been wrongly executed. this is a mistake that you cannot fix and is a terrible occurrence. if the death penalty was not in place, this would give investigators the time necessary to realize and declare the person innocent instead of just killing them. http://www.deathpenalty.org... the death penalty is actually "applied" almost at random. it depends more on the politics and judges of the court than on the offense itself. http://www.americamagazine.org... frankly, i see absolutely no benefits of the death penalty.

legalization of marijuanaresponse 1: what supports your claim that marijuana dealers should be the least of the issue? saying what would happen to the drug if it was legalized does not address my initial premise which raised the issue of the dealers being unemployed if marijuana was legalized. it doesn't look like my p1 was actually addressed. response 2: cigarettes were used as an example by me because they were brought up by you. however, the issue itself does not involve them. my argument was that marijuana increases the probability of lung damage and the eradication of cigarettes is not relevant to it. your red herring is furthered when you bring up the cost of something that has nothing to do with the legalization of marijuana. response 3: while you have given no proof of the side effects of legal medications that can replace marijuana, here is proof that marijuana is no exception when it comes to negative side effects: http://www.lcsun-news.com... marijuana, if legalized, would not necessarily be a better alternative to other medicines because just as other medicines, it has risks and side effects. response 4: i would expect society to have trouble utilizing marijuana with closed eyes. my argument is that marijuana should not be legalized. i did not bash medical use nor did i support drug dealers. bringing up the issue of putting thousands of street dealers out of a job supported my argument as did my claim that marijuana's medical use is not more effective than that of other medicines. my initial arguments stand to support my conclusion that marijuana should not be legalized. this debate is over as we are only supposed to have 3 rounds. let's both write "ok" for the next round so that the debate will be concluded and move into its voting period.

america should support blanket amnesty for illegal immigrants.illegal immigrants should not be granted amnesty because it would skyrocket the financial strain on social services. according to the center for immigration studies, 57% of both legal and illegal immigrant homes are receiving the benefits of at least one welfare program ("is it"illegal immigrants?"). if granted amnesty, illegal immigrants would become eligible for full benefits and the burden on legal, taxpaying citizens would increase drastically. in addition, businesses, especially if banned from outsourcing, will turn to the equally as detrimental technique of "in-sourcing," or hiring illegal aliens in the u.s. although the senate is demanding that employers prove that american workers are "unwilling or unavailable" to take these jobs before they hire illegal immigrants, they will find ways around the law in order to make the most profit at the least expense by hiring cheap labor ("is it"illegal immigrants?"). for these reasons, only legal immigration should be supported in the united states. works cited "is it a bad idea to legalize the illegal immigrants?" illegal immigration statistics. 2013. web. 14 october 2013. http://www.illegalimmigrationstatistics.org....

gay 'marriage' and civil union are forms of legal political corruptionyou claim that gay marriage is not in the public interest, yet the majority of the public (1) supports it. while private politicians are certainly among those who support gay marriage, by your argument any law passed represents corruption. you fail to explain how gay marriage is not in the public good, so i clicked over to the comments, where you stated that gay marriage wasn't in the public interest because only heterosexual marriages produce children. yet this makes zero sense as a condemnation of gay marriage; it's not like gay people would be having kids if gay marriage was illegal. in fact, gay marriage can help alleviate the problem of heterosexual marriages that don't work and leave children in the foster home system, since gay couples adopt much more regularly and tend to be better parents than heterosexual couples (2). anyway, only 3.8% of americans identify as lgbtq, and whether or not they have kids has very little effect on the population anyway. unless you're some kind of a spread-the-race nationalist, i can't see why this argument holds water. to summarize, you fail to explain why gay marriage does not represent the public interest, and i had to dig through the comments to find a specific point to rebut. 1. http://www.pewforum.org... 2. http://www.medicaldaily.com...

abolish the death penaltymy opponent is clearly basing all of his argument on the fact that the death penalty costs a lot of money. while it is true that the u.s. has trillions of dollars in debt, we must not cut budgets for giving justice to those who deserve it. rather then that, we should cut the funding for things such as our military which right now the u.s. is giving $663.8 billion [2] and the united nations. the u.s funds the un more then anyother country of the world. we fund 22% of the un's regular budget[3]. this comes to my questions. do we really need a military with that much funding? do we really need to fund the un that much? in the pledge of allegiance to the american flag we say...

religion(pro) vs science(con)i disagree that religion has been running longer than science.religion: a particular system of faith and worship.science, like god, is everpresent and existed before humans started religions. while it's true that religion is ancient, it doesn't necessarily prove that religion is true. to even say religion is true is actually weird because there are different beliefs in each religion, causing debate amongst religious believers. so everyone's conclusion is that there is either only one true religion, or that no religions are true. i don't see how all religions can be true- for instance: abrahamic religions believe that there is only one god and other religions, such as hinduism, believe in lesser gods; it is impossible for both of them to exist, either one of them or none of them are correct.i also have to say that the line in the hanuman chalisa, is more of an approximation, as the distance of the sun to earth is 92,955,807 miles (source: http://www.space.com...).even though it's close, that itself won't prove that the hanuman chalisa is correct, no matter how long ago it was written as many will argue that it is just a lucky hunch.as for the gayatri mantra, i don't know why nasa would study that since its a space agency. then agaim, i don't know that much about nasa anyway, i would like a link showing where you got this information. that is interesting, but doesn't prove that religion existed before science and that religion, or atleast hinduism is true.

the existence of godthanks to devient.genie for his contribution to the debate. unfortunately, he seems to have completely ignored my argument. i’ll make this round short.the thomistic cosmological argument con ignored st. thomas’s argument concerning motion, and so there is nothing to respond here. con's anti-christian polemic con then goes on to attack christianity with multiple points. i’ll remind con that we are debating the existence of god, not the truth of any particular religion. so even if con’s case were coherent, it’s not relevant to the debate at hand. concluding with “in other words, the christian story is a fairly tale, just like the other three examples we have examined,” con has ignored my positive case for the existence of god and instead advanced three points in support of his anti-christian polemic. since christianity is a revealed religion -- a religion that acknowledges divine revelation and intervention as fundamental to its authenticity -- its truth concerns both natural theology and revealed theology. however, the existence of god is by definition a matter relevant to natural theology; so, this debate only concerns natural theology. since st. thomas argued only from nature, and not from any sort of divine relevation, as proof of the existence of god, my thesis stands strong in the face of con's barely coherent criticism. so it seems that devient.genie has completely missed the point of the debate.

men’s sports are more popular than women’s and so should receive more media coverage.the role of the media is not to be a tool for the implementation of social policy. it is instead to inform the public and provide entertainment. however, it would be naïve and short-sighted to believe that the media should report and cover everything equally so as to perfectly inform the public. the nature of media coverage is such that there is a limited amount each media company can cover. there is a limit on air-time available to radio and tv stations and there is a limit to the number of pages newspapers can print. media companies thus have to make a choice regarding what to report and to what extent. it makes sense for more coverage to be offered for stories and events that are deemed to be of greater importance by the general public (irrespective of its objective value). for example, news about local flooding in queensland australia may be hugely important for australians, but considerably less so for people in europe or the americas. similarly, a british victory at the world schools debating championships would not be (by and large) seen as important as a british victory in the football or rugby world cup. we would thus expect the media to cover each story according to its popularity. given the considerably lower public interest in most women’s sport compared to men’s, it thus makes sense for men’s to receive more media coverage. that coverage is based on popularity rather than media bias is shown by more than two thirds of media reports not in any way enhancing stereotypes, the media are therefore not specifically discriminating against women in sport.[1] [1] ‘sports, media and stereotypes women and men in sports and media’, centre for gender equality, 2006, p.19.

gun ownership increases the risk of suicidethere are substantial exceptions to that correlation, for example japan has the world’s 5th highest suicide rate but very low gun ownership.[1] as the proposition concedes, the availability of firearms is not a direct cause of suicide and thus the restriction of availability of firearms can only have a marginal effect on the suicide rate.

the christian god can not be proven"i am unable to prove the christian god and very much doubt my opponent can either.go"even if neither pro or i can prove that the christian god exists, this does not mean that his existence cannot be proven. if the christian god exists, he is omnipotent:“with man this is impossible, but with god all things are possible.”"for nothing will be impossible with god.” - luke 1:37 "great is our lord, and abundant in power; his understanding is beyond measure." - psalm 147:5 since, if the christian go exists, he is omnipotent, then it follows necessarily from omnipotence that he could prove himself if he wanted to. thus, if god exists, it would be necessarily true that the christian god's existence can be proven. what does this mean? this means that the resolution, without additional support, begs the question against christian theism. only if god does not exist, would it be true that the christian god cannot be proven. this is because, once more, if the christian god exists the he can be proven (he can prove himself); thus negating the resolution. since the resolution presupposes that the christian god does not exist, pro must show that the christian god does not exist, because the burden of proof is on pro (it is not shared, as he started the debate). as it stands, the resolution has been negated.vote con.

states ought not possess nuclear weapons.definitions: states- a division of a federal state (such as the states of the united states of america).[1] states ought not possess nuclear weapons as it would force individual states to develop foreign policy, as they would have possession of weapons of mass destruction that are not the property of any form of federal government. since historically foreign policy has largely been the responsibility of federal governments.[2] this would cause unnecessary tension between the two entities, and may even result in a civil war. the possession of nuclear weapons best belongs to federal governments. i thank my opponent and eagerly await his response in the next round. sources [1] http://geography.about.com...

the threat of nuclear weapons falling into the hands of rogue states and terrorists increases as more countries possess themthere are many dangerous dictators and tyrants, many of who covet the possession of nuclear weapons not just for the purpose of defence, but also for that of intimidating their neighbours.[1] such leaders should not possess nuclear weapons, nor should they ever be facilitated in their acquisition. for example, iran has endeavoured for years on a clandestine nuclear weapons program that, were it recognized as a legitimate pursuit, could be increased in scale and completed with greater speed. the result of such an achievement could well destabilize the middle east and would represent a major threat to the existence of a number of states within the region, particularly israel. furthermore, the risk of nuclear weapons, or at least weapons-grade material, falling into the hands of dissidents and terrorists increases substantially when there are more of them and larger numbers of countries possess them. additionally, many countries in the developing world lack the capacity to safely secure weapons if they owned them, due to lack of technology, national instability, and government corruption.[2] recognizing the rights of these countries to hold nuclear weapons vastly increases the risk of their loss or misuse.

racism in america has always been white/non-white, not black/non-black or whitewith this we can see that the this white on white racism is outside of the resolution and thus con wins the debate.i think you read it wrong. i meant black/non-black or black/white. there's a reason the white was on the other side of the slash.but to disprove your case: the irish, italians and spanish were not always considered white either.http://en.wikipedia.org...http://www.africaresource.com...anyways, more examples of racism being directed at non-whites altogether not just blacks: mexicans lynched santa cruz, california more pictures of mexicans lynchedhttp://www.gateschili.org...japanese lynched

manmade global climate change is real and a threat.there is so much information on the topic that rather than reiterate all of it i will make a short summary. also burden of proof will be 51% on my opponent and 49% on me. manmade global climate change is the general increase in temperature at rapid rates that is mainly caused by co2 from industry increases. carbon dioxide is at 404.48 parts per million and the temperature has increased 1.4 degrees fahrenheit since 1880. [0]although 1.4 degrees doesn't sound much, it ends up being a lot. this is because not all areas of the world heat at the same rate and such a rapid change is hard to adapt to. there is no signs of relief from climate change. my opponent will attempt to deny climate change, but please remember how long the cigarette companies held out despite the science being heavily against them. now we know as sure as the sun rises that cigarettes cause cancer. i can honestly state that as sure as the sun rises, global climate change is upon us and is a threat. al gore's inconvenient truth is still a master piece, and i will not accept defeat until my opponent can defeat the documentary. [1]not watching al gore's documentary is no excuse. if your a serious climate change denier, it just makes you look uncommitted and shallow to criticize climate change without watching the premier documentary. thank you for reading. thanks in advance for accepting the debate. sources0. http://climate.nasa.gov... 1. http://www.imdb.com...
