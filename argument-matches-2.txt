marijuana legalizationi accept this debate and the bop.marijuana should be legalized because:1. not as dangerous as certain legal substancesthere are 0 deaths from marijuana in the u.s. per year, [1] as contrasted to the 80,000 annual deaths from alcohol and 443,000 from smoking per year in the u.s. [2][3] this means that if we should keep alcohol and smoking legal, we also have to legalize marijuana; because it is less dangerous than alcohol and smoking, in terms of deaths. 2. boosts economyif marijuana were to be legalized; it will create many new jobs for the people. this is because we need people to farm, process, inspect and sell marijuana; if it were to be allowed for commercial use. just like any other instry, the marijuana industry will create jobs, effectively reducing the unemployment rate and allowing people to earn money to spend and boost other industries as well. conclusionbecause of the economical benefits of legalizing marijuana, as well as marijuana being less dangerous than many other substances that are legal, marijuana should be legalized.[1]http://www.drugwarfacts.org...[2]http://www.cdc.gov...[3]http://www.cdc.gov...

is it right for america to have nuclear weaponspro's burden is to defend his arguments, con's to deconstruct them per standard rules of bop.pro's argument is essentially this, that the u.s. having nuclear weapons is good because they can use those weapons as leverage to keep irresponsible countries from assuming nuclear power and protecting countries without nuclear weapons. there are a few problems with these sentiments.(i) pro is presupposing that the u.s. will act responsible with those nuclear weapons. you can't just theorize into existence responsible states. furthermore seeing as power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely, i see no reason to give the u.s. the benefit of the doubt concerning whether they'd choose to use those weapons responsibly and pro has as of yet provided no reason for us to think so.(ii) pro is also ignoring the fact that all nuclear weapons were created equal so one country having access to a large number of them doesn't put them in a necessarily superior strategic position relative to countries with only a few nuclear weapons. one can be sure that if japan or any of its allies had access to any nuclear weapons in 1945, that the u.s. would not have been able to use them on it. therefore pro needs to show why other countries can't just use the same strategy against the u.s. to force it into aligning with their interests. empirical evidence gives credence to this idea given the general lack of u.s. military action against north korea which is owed almost entirely to its possession of nukes.

trump will make a good presidenti feel that trump would make a good president because of his policies on immigration, stances on terrorism and experience with economic management. the first reason trump would make a good president is the fact that he will be more strict on immigrants. building a wall is a smart idea because even though people cross over our borders illegally, we still allow some of them to reside here. this is wrong because the u.s. government is rewarding them for breaking laws. when trump builds a border fence, this will stop because the immigrants will have to cross over legally and the bad ones will be filtered out easily. the second reason donald trump would make a good president is his stance on terrorism. isis does horrible things and they must be stopped. a temporary restriction on muslims entering the country is a good idea because, lets face facts, most terrorists are muslims. if we put a restriction on muslim's entering the country, it will be much easier to fight against isis without having terrorists in our country. finally, trump would make a good leader because of his experience with economics. donald trump already owns a mufti billion dollar company meaning he has experience with economic crisis's and money management. the debt has gone up 7.7 trillion dollars under obama's rule. (http://useconomy.about.com...) and having an experienced business man in office is a good idea. these reasons listed above and many others are why donald trump would make a good president.

god probably doesn't exist.thank you for responding so quickly. i still believe that you have the burden of proof because you need to show me why god does, or probably does exist. by stating that i have the burden of proof is essentially asking me to prove non-existance. i can't really prove that unicorns, fairies, dragons (the giant fire-breathing ones), and minotaurs don't exist, so why should i be the one proving that god exists? therefore, in a debate i feel that it would make more sense for the proponent of god to attempt to prove his existance than asking a non-believer to prove he doesn't exist. also, i specifically stated it in the rules. my definition of god is what i wanted con to prove existed. i was arguing that 'the creator and ruler of the universe and source of all moral authority' probably doesn't have actual being.1. god is the creator and ruler of the universe, and source of all moral authority (pro's definition)2. god exists if it has actual being (pro's definition)3. it is impossible to be the creator and ruler of the universe, and source of all moral authority, yet not exist4. therefore god must exist1. this definition of god is what you are attempting to prove to me. you fail to provide any proof that he exists; you simply state it as fact.2. i agree.3. i would agree if you actually proved that god existed. 4. see above.

the best method to determine whether or not man made climate change is true is reduction of co2.full topic: the best method to determine whether or not man made climate change is true or false is to dramatically reduce man made levels of co2.we need to take drastic measures to reduce man made co2 levels asap. i've become convinced of this due to the climate change deniers. simply, put the climate change deniers are correct, there is not enough evidence. therefore, we need to accumulate more evidence via experimentation. thus far all we have done is endlessly discuss if climate change is real or false and collecting observation evidence. empirical evidence is split into two grounds.a. observation evidenceb. scientific experimentsall i've seen is a, thus far. we need b, and we need to know soon. the only way i can imagine to test this theory of global climate change is via experimentation. we must take control and change a variable. i vote co2 is the best variable.now as co2 as the variable we have two choices, to raise or lower co2 levels. considering it would be immoral to raise co2 levels given the observation evidence, we can only lower co2 levels.since a small decrease in co2 levels would be more difficult to determine, a large decrease in amount of co2 produced by man made sources is the only solution. that way if climate change is caused by a confounding factor we will have a better chance of acknowledging that confounding factor and taking corrective actions. to recap, we need more evidence for whether or not climate change is true in the form of experimental evidence. lowering man-made co2 dramatically is the best and only moral option. thanks for reading and accepting the debate in advance.

there are practical problems with banning abortionnot only is banning abortion a problem in theory, offending against a woman's right to choose, it is also a practical problem. enforcing an abortion ban would require a quite degrading and inhumane treatment of those women who wished to have their fetus terminated. moreover, if pregnant women traveled abroad, they would be able to have an abortion in a country where it was legal. either the state takes the draconian measure of restricting freedom of movement, or it must admit that its law is unworkable in practice and abolish it. the middle way of tacitly accepting foreign terminations would render hypocritical the much-vaunted belief in the sanctity of life. the demand for abortions will always exist; making abortion illegal, will simply drive it underground and into conditions where the health and safety of the woman might be put at risk.1 example: polish women, living in a country with extremely restrictive abortion laws often go abroad to the netherlands, germany and austria for abortions.2 women who are not lucky enough to live in environments such as the eu may be forced to go to foreign countries and undergo underground, unsafe abortions. 1 warsaw businnes journal
